  <p style="text-align:center">On my project, I felt like I did most of what was required. I usually like to go above and beyond with my projects, but it was hard with this because I chose a somewhat challenging topic’ and I was just confused by some of the things. I really liked the cartoon I made, but I don’t know if the art style is too “familiar.” I ended up procrastinating a lot because of the project’s ambiguity, I struggled to get my feet off the ground and things done. I somewhat feel I relied of the USCCR source too much at times. This project is different though, in which you get some freedom, but I kind of feel that it wasn’t free enough to let my creative juices flow fully and too free to let me know exactly what to do. In the beginning, the projet seemed fun, but in the end it was more of a hassle than I would have liked.
