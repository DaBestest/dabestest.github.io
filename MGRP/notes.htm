      <h1> Artifact 1</h1>
My first artifact is a newspaper article, which explains the terrible food, water, and healthcare at border facilities. "'We heard stories of rancid bread, expired food, putrid water, and medicine that seemed like it came from a dollar store'" (USCCR 2019). In my newspaper article, I showcase this information by explaining how people are getting sick from the food and water given. I also show how there is a lack of good medical care for the migrants. “‘[Staff doesn’t] listen to detained immigrants when they complain about their pain and illnesses’”(USCCR 2019). I presented this information by explaining how staff at detention facilities are denying proper medical care to migrants. I tell about how employees don’t listen to the immigrants' medical needs.
<h1>Artifact 2</h1>
My second artifact is a cartoon, which explains the ways immigrants are being stopped from entering.”Immigration expert and Republican Senator from Vermont William P. Dillingham introduced a measure to create immigration quotas” (Office of the Historian). In the cartoon, I present this information by showing an immigrant being stopped from entering because the quota was met. The reason the guy is named Johnson Reed is because that is the name of the act. “The authority allowed U.S. officials to turn away migrants who came to the U.S.-Mexico border…” (APNEWS 2023).  I show this information by showing migrants being rejected using title 42. Title 42 made it so that immigrants couldn’t enter the U.S. because of Covid reasons.
<h1>Artifact 3</h1>
My third artifact is an editorial, which explains how immigrants are being treated badly by detention facility employees. “...individuals in detention have been sexually and physically abused while in solitary confinement" (USCCR 2019). In the editorial, I present this information by explaining how people are being abused in detention facillities. I also just use the quote. “Psychologists argue that these separations could affect children significantly, and very young children may not remember their mothers at all" (YOUNGZINE 2018). I show this by talking about how kids get separated from their parents. I say that it would create mental problems for kids.
