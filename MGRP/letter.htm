        Dear Reader,<br><br><br><br>



It has been a long journey making this project, but I finally made it. All the ambiguity of the project has made it hard, but here I am.
<br><br>
In the beginning, we talked about the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and had to choose one (or two in my case) of the thirty articles in it. I chose fourteen and five. I thought fourteen was interesting. The overview we were given didn’t help to explain what it meant for me, so I wanted to learn it and do something noone else was. I later figured about it was talking abut immigration, instead of it just being a rewording of article thirteen. I chose my topic to be about the U.S. Mexico border crisis because I had used to watch the news and had herald about it all the time. Not really knowing much though, I pushed forward.
<br><br>
For learning about the article, I wanted to know ever facet and fixture of what it meant. What is a non-political crime? What counts as persecution? What kinds of countries use it? Most of my information on my article and the crisis was from a quick google search. I only used Gale once or twice. Most of my information came from a pdf created by the government itself entitled, “Trauma at the Border.”
<br><br>
After powering through all the researching and typing, I realize how big of a procrastinator I really am. I delayed a lot of my work and that ended up creating problems for me. The project really felt like too much. It increased my stress and made me sad everytime I knew I had to work on it. It felt like a huge accomplishment when I finished the artifact one because it was so hard for me. I do not want to do this again. That gratification was not there when I finished my entire project, though, because it was mostly rushed.
<br><br>
This project made me realize a lot of things and not necessarily good things. I hope I don’t have to do something like this again because of how stress inducing it was, but that really is just my personality. My personality I think is what makes me such a bad essay writer. I want to pour my heart and soul out into it, but I can’t because of the rigid guidelines. I wish it wasn’t like this, but I can’t make a difference.
