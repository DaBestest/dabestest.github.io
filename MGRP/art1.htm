Detention Facilities are Treating Immigrants like Prisoners
</h1>
<p style="font-size:12px; font-family: Courier New"><b>
Immigrants are not being treated fairly. Thanks to the border facilities not providing adequate food, water, and medication, thousands are dying. All around the U.S., negligence is killing these people.
<br><br>
The ongoing border crisis is causing thousands of South and Central American immigrants to be caught up in detention facilities all over the southern U.S.. Many of these facilities are not giving people enough food and water, and any food and water they do get is dirty and stale. Any request for extra water is denied by facility employees.
<br><br>
“‘…the water is often green, and has reportedly caused headaches and rashes’” (USCCR 2019).
<br><br>
Food with maggots and worms in it is not uncommon among immigrant detention facilities. Eating these kinds of foods can result in salmonella, a harmful bacteria that results in stomach cramps, diarrhea, fever, and, in rare cases, death.
<br><br>
When detainees are ill or injured, proper medical care is withheld. Doctors are only available for a small period of time, constricting the amount people who can get care. Immigrants are also stopped from getting care by employees.
<br><br>
“‘Awful health care: one doctor for 1,000 immigrants working 24 hours a week!’” (USCCR 2019).
<br><br>
The many problems in detention facilities all combine to make the conditions for the immigrants living in them miserable. Our own government is using minimal effort to stop these problems from happening at the border. What is happening is a public eyesore from the government, damaging their reputation with its own citizens.
<br><br>
U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) are fighting back against the little bit that the government is doing to stop the harsh conditions of facilities, fighting against closing detention facilities and reopening closed ones. 
<br><br>
The conditions faced are deplorable. 
<br><br>
“‘What I experienced was the worst experience in my life’” (USCCR 2019).
