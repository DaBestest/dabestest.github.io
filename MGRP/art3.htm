<h1>Edison’s Opinion on the U.S. Mexico Border Crisis Detention Facility Treatment of Immigrants</h1>
  <p>	On the border with the U.S., thousands of people are coming through Mexico to seek a better life in America. After fighting their way across the border, they get detained in facilities across the country. Even after all of their hardship, they still have more to go. Staff at the facilities mistreat and abuse the immigrants at the facilities.
<br><br>
	In the U.S. report “Trauma on the Border,” it is stated that,
<br><br>
	“...individuals in detention have been sexually and physically abused while in                       solitary confinement" (USCCR 2019).
<br><br>
	These people who travel miles to escape persecution arrive to find more. What immigrants have to go through is effectively torture. It is “cruel and unusual,” but these people aren’t citizens, so they don’t get any rights.
<br><br>
	Not only are the adults being mistreated, the children are too. They are being sexually and physically abused and they are being separated from their parents. This creates many mental problems for growing children.
<br><br>
	Many solutions can be employed to help the problems faced in detention facilities. There are three I would like to present.<br><br>
  <h2>Solution 1: Increased Budget</h2>
<br><br>
	With a better budget, payroll can be increased for employees so that they don't feel as much of an impulse to act out.
<br><br>
<h2>Solution 2: Firing Bad Staff</h2>
<br><br>
	Certain people could come and check on the conditions of detainees. Any staff that mistreats the migrants would be fired.
<br><br>
<h2>Solution 3: Change Detention Facilities</h2>
<br><br>
	This may seem a bit radical, but changing detention facilities to be more like Ellis Island might be beneficial. I would stopped prolonged stays and bad treatment overall.
